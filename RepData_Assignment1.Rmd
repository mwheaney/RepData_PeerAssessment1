title: "RepData Assignment 1"

This is assignment 1 for Reproducable Research. 
This file contains explaination and code required to process activity data as 
directed. 

The first code block reads the data in and filters out NA values 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
a <- read.csv("../data/activity.csv")
af <- a[complete.cases(a),]
```

The next code block calculates the sums of steps per day and generates a 
histogram of them. 

```{r}
sums <- aggregate(af[, 1], list(af$date), sum)
hist(sums[,2], main="Steps per day", ylim = c(0,30), xlab="Steps")
```

```{r}
means <- aggregate(af[, 1], list(a$date), mean)
medians <- aggregate(af[, 1], list(a$date), median)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
